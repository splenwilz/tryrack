# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Environment Variables

This app uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:

```bash
# API Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://172.20.10.2:8000

# WorkOS Configuration  
EXPO_PUBLIC_WORKOS_CLIENT_ID=client_01K86PVP3MEA1X2WZDKQYQP7HW

# OAuth Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_SCHEME=frontend
EXPO_PUBLIC_OAUTH_REDIRECT_PATH=auth/callback
```

**Note:** In Expo, environment variables must be prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` to be accessible in the client-side code.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
