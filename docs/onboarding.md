# Onboarding Screen Implementation

This implementation provides a modern, swipeable onboarding experience for the TryRack app that matches the exact design specifications shown in the provided images.

## Features

### üéØ **Carousel Navigation**
- **Swipeable screens**: Users can swipe left/right to navigate between onboarding screens
- **Smooth animations**: Powered by React Native Reanimated for 60fps animations
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to different screen sizes automatically

### üìä **Progress Indicator**
- **Visual progress dots**: Shows current position in the onboarding flow at the very top
- **Interactive navigation**: Tap any dot to jump to that specific screen
- **Animated transitions**: Smooth transitions between active states

### üñºÔ∏è **Image Integration**
- **Optimized images**: Uses Expo Image for better performance and caching
- **Smooth scaling**: Images scale and fade during transitions
- **Content fit**: Images maintain aspect ratio and fit properly

### üé® **Modern UI Design**
- **Clean typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper font weights and sizes
- **Consistent spacing**: Follows design system principles
- **Platform-specific styling**: Adapts to iOS and Android conventions
- **No tab navigation**: Clean onboarding experience without tab bars

## Screen Content

The onboarding includes three screens with content that matches the TryRack app design:

1. **Home Service, Redefined** - Introduction to premium home services
2. **Virtual Try-On Technology** - AI-powered try-on features
3. **Smart Wardrobe Management** - Digital wardrobe and outfit suggestions

## Architecture

### **Component Structure**
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx              # Root component with navigation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onboarding.tsx          # Main onboarding screen component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _layout.tsx            # Navigation stack configuration

hooks/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ use-onboarding.ts      # Custom hook for onboarding state management
```

### **Key Components**

#### `OnboardingScreen`
- Main carousel component using FlatList
- Handles swipe gestures and scroll events
- Manages screen transitions and animations

#### `ProgressIndicator`
- Custom progress dots component
- Handles tap navigation to specific screens
- Animated active state transitions

#### `OnboardingItem`
- Individual screen renderer
- Image scaling and opacity animations
- Text content layout

#### `useOnboarding`
- Custom hook for state management
- AsyncStorage integration for persistence
- Navigation logic handling

## Technical Implementation

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **FlatList**: Efficient rendering for large datasets
- **getItemLayout**: Pre-calculated item dimensions for smooth scrolling
- **scrollEventThrottle**: Optimized scroll event handling
- **Image caching**: Expo Image provides automatic caching

### **Animation System**
- **React Native Reanimated**: Native thread animations
- **Shared values**: Efficient animation state management
- **Interpolation**: Smooth value transitions between states
- **Extrapolation**: Proper animation clamping

### **State Management**
- **AsyncStorage**: Persistent onboarding completion state
- **Custom hooks**: Clean separation of concerns
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout

## Usage

### **Navigation Flow**
1. App launches ‚Üí Check onboarding status
2. If not completed ‚Üí Show onboarding screens
3. User swipes through screens or taps progress dots
4. On completion ‚Üí Navigate to main app
5. Skip option available at any time

### **Customization**
The onboarding screens are easily customizable by modifying the `onboardingScreens` array:

```typescript
const onboardingScreens: OnboardingScreen[] = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Your Title',
    description: 'Your description',
    image: require('@/assets/images/your-image.png'),
    buttonText: 'Continue',
  },
  // Add more screens...
];
```

## Dependencies

- **React Native Reanimated**: For smooth animations
- **Expo Image**: For optimized image handling
- **AsyncStorage**: For persistent state management
- **Expo Router**: For navigation

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Performance**: Uses FlatList for efficient rendering
2. **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and screen reader support
3. **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for edge cases
6. **Code Organization**: Clean separation of concerns
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments and JSDoc

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Fallback navigation for scroll failures
- Loading states for async operations
- Platform-specific optimizations

This implementation follows React Native best practices and provides a production-ready onboarding experience.
