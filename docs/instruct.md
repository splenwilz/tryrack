> 🧠 **Development Guidelines**
>
> * 🤖 Always remember you have context7 for documentation and reasoning reference.
> * 🧩 Do **not** bloat or spam code — write clean, modular, and minimal code.
> * 🔄 Split work into **subtasks** and wait for my confirmation after each step before continuing.
> * 📚 Every line of code must be **justified** with a **comment** referencing the **official documentation** (when possible).
> * ❓If uncertain, **always consult the official docs first** — never guess.
> * 🤖 Use the **robot emoji** in your replies to confirm you still have context.
